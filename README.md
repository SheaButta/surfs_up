## Overview of Project

### Purpose
While on vacation in Hawaii, I had an idea of opening a "Surf n'Shake" shop.  I could use some of my savings; however, an investor will definitely turn my dream into reality.  I decided to reachout to an investor named W. Avy.  He really likes the idea but requires more information about temperature trends before committing to this idea.  W. Avy has requested temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii. This will help determine if this business would be sustainable year-round.  The standard data analysis principles were used which includes; (1) Determine the number of rows and columns in the data; (2) Data types used; and (3) Is the data readable?

__Requirements for W. Avy__
- Temperature data for June months
- Temperature data for December months

## Resources

- SQLite
- A SQLite database named: hawaii.sqlite
  
## Results
After analyzing the data, I was able produce the required information for W. Avy.
 
The temperature data for the month of June is illustrated below.

The temperature data for the month of December is illustrated below.

From the analysis above, I have identifed three (3) major points;
- The temperature in both June and December are in the low 70s.
- The high temperature of June and December are in the low to mid 80s.
- The standard deviation appears to be about 3 degress from the mean.

 
## Summary
The "Surf n'Shake" shop seems to be a sustainable business based on the data from June and December.  An average temperature in the low 70s for both June and December, seems to indicate surfing can be done year-round and if you can surf year-round, you can definitely eat ice-cream year-round.  There are two (2) additional weather queries that might provide some additional insight and strenghten this business plan; (1). A query on the precipitation in the month of June; and (2) a query on the precipitation in the month of December.
